## What is Sandboxie-Plus?

**Sandboxie-Plus** is a powerful and modern open-source sandboxing application for Windows. It allows users to run programs in an isolated virtual environment, preventing them from making permanent changes to the underlying operating system. This is especially useful for testing untrusted software, safely browsing the web, or opening suspicious files without risking infection or system damage.

With Sandboxie-Plus, you can:
- Run applications in a secure sandbox.
- Protect your system from malware and viruses.
- Test software without affecting your main OS.
- Browse the internet safely with an added layer of security.

It is the continuation of the original Sandboxie project, now with improved features, better performance, and ongoing community support. Whether you're a security enthusiast, developer, or casual user, Sandboxie-Plus offers a reliable way to keep your system safe.
